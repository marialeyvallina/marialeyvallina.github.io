I was born in 1993 in a small town of the mining valleys in Asturias, Spain. 

When I was eighteen I enroled in the Software Engineering Bachelor at the University of Oviedo. I enjoyed it inmensely, but in the end of my studies I felt that web developing wasn't challening enough. I therefore enroled in the Masters in Artificial Intelligence in Barcelona, where I had the oportunity of doing my Master Thesis with Prof. Petia Radeva and had my first contact with Computer Vision. Somehow, I still had not had enough of a challenge, so when a friend suggested that I applied for a PhD position in the University of Groningen I did immediately. 

I am currently working on finishing my PhD dissertation, which is focused on representation learning for image similarity.

In my free time I enjoy reading, watching movies and hiking.
